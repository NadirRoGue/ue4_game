# First Person Shooter game built with Unreal Engine 4.8.3

This repository holds the source code files (Visual studio project files and C++ headers/source code files)

The Unreal Engine files (uassets) are too big to be stored in GitHub without a github enterprise account.

For further details about the game, do not hesitate to contact me.
